# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The purpose of this respository is to scrape data about Mars and assemble it using Python and HTML into a website that updates everytime you push the "Scrape New Data" button.
The button will pull Mars news, the most recent featured image displayed on the JPL NASA Mars website and pictures of all 4 hemispheres of mars as well as their names.
